By using piezoelectric technology, we can able to transform mechanical
stress into electricity. Due to this emerging technology, we can able to
achieve the energy that is used for minimal purposes. In this context, the
development of an automated energy-generating device using piezoelectric
technology which is used for charging mobile phones will be an efficient
solution.
